- The conditional moments on Moan's slides don't work as we cannot get rid of conditioning. It's not helpful to have the moments, conditioned on the absorption time
- Using end-point conditioned statistics, we have in theory access to the sojourn time in each state but this would require a double loop, looping through all states and all epochs. Currently, we just can just compute the end-point conditioned time until absorption so that we only have to loop through the epochs. If we simply apply the reward to the sub-intensity matrix, then this causes a rescaling of time, and it does not seem to be possible to simply rescale the time accordingly by computing a single scalar for each epoch.
- The Laplace transform can be computed analytically for a discrete demography by splitting up the integral. This is more efficient that using end-point conditioning, but in this case, we can only apply the rewards to the sub-intensity matrix, which also causes scaling-problems.
- We could thus implement a tool, that uses standard phase-type theory for time-homogenous models. For time-inhomogenous models we would have to use end-point conditioning. For simple statistics using default rewards, we can use calculate the Laplace transform of the density on Moan's slides.
